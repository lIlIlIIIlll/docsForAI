# Groq Built-In Tools

Built-in (or server-side) tools are the easiest way to add agentic capabilities to your application. Unlike [remote MCP](https://console.groq.com/docs/tool-use/remote-mcp) where you connect to external servers, or [local tool calling](https://console.groq.com/docs/tool-use/local-tool-calling) where you implement functions yourself, built-in tools require **zero orchestration**.

Just call the API, specify which tools you want to allow the model to use, and Groq's systems will handle the rest - tool execution, orchestration, and returning the final answer.

Built-in tools are not HIPAA Covered Cloud Services under Groq's Business Associate Addendum at this time. These tools are also not available currently for use with regional / sovereign endpoints.

## [How Built-In Tools Work](#how-builtin-tools-work)

With built-in tools, **execution happens entirely on Groq's servers**. The model autonomously calls built-in tools (web search, code execution) and handles the entire agentic loop internally. You get one response with everything completed.

Your App → Makes request to Groq API with allowed_tools parameter
   ↓
Groq API → Makes request to LLM with built-in tool definitions from 
           the allowed_tools parameter
         ← Model returns tool_calls with built-in tool names (or, if no 
           tool calls are needed, returns final response)
   ↓
Groq API → Parses tool call arguments server-side
         → Makes request to built-in tool with tool call arguments
         ← Built-in tool returns results
   ↓
Groq API → Makes another request to LLM with tool results
         ← Model returns more tool_calls (returns to step 3), or 
           returns final response
   ↓
Your App

## [Which Models Support Built-In Tools](#which-models-support-builtin-tools)

### [1\. Groq Compound Systems](#1-groq-compound-systems)

Groq's **Compound** systems are purpose-built for agentic workflows with a full suite of built-in tools:

**Models:**

* `groq/compound` \- Supports multiple tools per request
* `groq/compound-mini` \- Single tool per request, 3x lower latency

**Available Tools:**

| Tool                                           | Identifier          |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| [Web Search](https://console.groq.com/docs/web-search)                 | web\_search         |
| [Code Execution](https://console.groq.com/docs/code-execution)         | code\_interpreter   |
| [Visit Website](https://console.groq.com/docs/visit-website)           | visit\_website      |
| [Browser Automation](https://console.groq.com/docs/browser-automation) | browser\_automation |
| [Wolfram Alpha](https://console.groq.com/docs/wolfram-alpha)           | wolfram\_alpha      |

**How to use Compound systems:**

Python

```
from groq import Groq

client = Groq()

completion = client.chat.completions.create(
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "What is the current weather in Tokyo?",
        }
    ],
    # Change model to compound to use built-in tools
    model="groq/compound",
)

print(completion.choices[0].message.content)
# Print all tool calls
# print(completion.choices[0].message.executed_tools)
```

```
import Groq from "groq-sdk";

const groq = new Groq();

export async function main() {
  const completion = await groq.chat.completions.create({
    messages: [
      {
        role: "user",
        content: "What is the current weather in Tokyo?",
      },
    ],
    // Change model to compound to use built-in tools
    model: "groq/compound",
  });

  console.log(completion.choices[0]?.message?.content || "");
  // Print all tool calls
  // console.log(completion.choices[0]?.message?.executed_tools || "");
}

main();
```

```
curl https://api.groq.com/openai/v1/chat/completions -s \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $GROQ_API_KEY" \
    -d '{
    "model": "groq/compound",
    "messages": [{
        "role": "user",
        "content": "What is the current weather in Tokyo?"
    }]
}'
```

The system automatically determines which tools to use based on the query and executes them server-side. You can optionally restrict which tools are available using the `compound_custom.tools.enabled_tools` parameter (see [Configuring Tools](#configuring-tools)).

**Example Response:**

JSON

```
{
  "id": "stub",
  "object": "chat.completion",
  "created": 1761750004,
  "model": "groq/compound",
  "choices": [{
    "index": 0,
    "message": {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "**Current weather in Tokyo (as of the latest report on Oct 29 2025, 11:00 pm JST)**\\n\\n| Parameter | Value |\\n|-----------|-------|\\n| **Temperature** | 53 °F ≈ 12 °C |...",
      "executed_tools": [{
        "index": 0,
        "type": "search",
        "arguments": "{\"query\": \"current weather in Tokyo\"}",
        "output": "Title: Weather for Tokyo, Japan...\\n..."
      }]
    },
    "finish_reason": "stop"
  }],
  "usage": {
    "prompt_tokens": 116,
    "completion_tokens": 571,
    "total_tokens": 7340
  }
}
```

The `executed_tools` array shows which tools were called during the request, including the arguments passed and the results returned.

### [Configuring Tools](#configuring-tools)

Use the `compound_custom.tools.enabled_tools` parameter to restrict which tools are available. Pass an array of tool identifiers: `web_search`, `code_interpreter`, `visit_website`, `browser_automation`, `wolfram_alpha`.

Python

```
from groq import Groq

client = Groq(
    default_headers={
        "Groq-Model-Version": "latest"
    }
)

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="groq/compound",
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Search for recent AI developments and then visit the Groq website"
        }
    ],
    compound_custom={
        "tools": {
            "enabled_tools": ["web_search", "visit_website"]
        }
    }
)
```

```
import Groq from "groq-sdk";

const groq = new Groq({
  defaultHeaders: {
    "Groq-Model-Version": "latest"
  }
});

const response = await groq.chat.completions.create({
  model: "groq/compound",
  messages: [
    {
      role: "user",
      content: "Search for recent AI developments and then visit the Groq website"
    }
  ],
  compound_custom: {
    tools: {
      enabled_tools: ["web_search", "visit_website"]
    }
  }
});
```

```
curl "https://api.groq.com/openai/v1/chat/completions" \
  -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${GROQ_API_KEY}" \
  -H "Groq-Model-Version: latest" \
  -d '{
        "messages": [
          {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Search for recent AI developments and then visit the Groq website"
          }
        ],
        "model": "groq/compound",
        "compound_custom": {
          "tools": {
            "enabled_tools": ["web_search", "visit_website"]
          }
        }
      }'
```

### [Compatibility with Local Tool Calling and Remote MCP Tools](#compatibility-with-local-tool-calling-and-remote-mcp-tools)

Groq's Compound systems only support built-in tools and cannot be used with local tool calling or remote MCP tools.

For more details, see the [Compound Built-In Tools documentation](https://console.groq.com/docs/compound/built-in-tools).

[Compound Built-In ToolsFull details on tool configuration, versioning, and advanced features](https://console.groq.com/docs/compound/built-in-tools) 

### [2\. GPT-OSS Models](#2-gptoss-models)

OpenAI's open-weight models support a subset of built-in tools:

**Models:**

* `openai/gpt-oss-120b`
* `openai/gpt-oss-20b`

**Available Tools:**

| Tool                                   | Identifier        |
| -------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| [Browser Search](https://console.groq.com/docs/browser-search) | browser\_search   |
| [Code Execution](https://console.groq.com/docs/code-execution) | code\_interpreter |

**Limitations:**

* Cannot use Visit Website, Browser Automation, or Wolfram Alpha

**How to use GPT-OSS models:**

Python

```
from groq import Groq

client = Groq()

# Automatically uses tools when needed
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="openai/gpt-oss-120b",
    messages=[{
        "role": "user",
        "content": "What's the current population of Tokyo?"
    }]
)

# Or specify which tool to enable
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="openai/gpt-oss-120b",
    messages=[{
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Search for recent AI developments"
    }],
    tools=[{"type": "browser_search"}]
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

```
import Groq from "groq-sdk";

const client = new Groq();

// Automatically uses tools when needed
const response = await client.chat.completions.create({
  model: "openai/gpt-oss-120b",
  messages: [{
    role: "user",
    content: "What's the current population of Tokyo?"
  }]
});

// Or specify which tool to enable
const responseWithTool = await client.chat.completions.create({
  model: "openai/gpt-oss-120b",
  messages: [{
    role: "user",
    content: "Search for recent AI developments"
  }],
  tools: [{ type: "browser_search" }]
});

console.log(response.choices[0].message.content);
```

GPT-OSS models are ideal when you need a large context window (131K tokens) with basic tool capabilities.

### [Configuring Tools](#configuring-tools)

Use the `tools` parameter with tool type objects. You can specify `browser_search` or `code_interpreter`.

Python

```
# Single tool
tools=[{"type": "browser_search"}]

# Or multiple tools
tools=[{"type": "browser_search"}, {"type": "code_interpreter"}]
```

```
// Single tool
const tools = [{ type: "browser_search" }];

// Or multiple tools
const tools = [{ type: "browser_search" }, { type: "code_interpreter" }];
```

### [Compatibility with Local Tool Calling and Remote MCP Tools](#compatibility-with-local-tool-calling-and-remote-mcp-tools)

GPT-OSS models can be used alongside local tool calling or remote MCP tools in the same request.

## [Viewing Tool Execution](#viewing-tool-execution)

To see which tools were used in a request, check the `executed_tools` field in the response:

Python

```
import os
from groq import Groq

client = Groq(api_key=os.environ.get("GROQ_API_KEY"))

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="groq/compound",
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "What did Groq release last week?"}
    ]
)
# Log the tools that were used to generate the response
print(response.choices[0].message.executed_tools)
```

```
import Groq from 'groq-sdk';

const groq = new Groq();

async function main() {
  const response = await groq.chat.completions.create({
    model: 'groq/compound',
    messages: [
      {
        role: 'user',
        content: 'What did Groq release last week?'
      }
    ]
  })
  // Log the tools that were used to generate the response
  console.log(response.choices[0].message.executed_tools)
}
main();
```

```
curl https://api.groq.com/openai/v1/chat/completions -s \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $GROQ_API_KEY" \
    -d '{
    "model": "groq/compound",
    "messages": [{
        "role": "user",
        "content": "What did Groq release last week?"
    }]
}'
```
